# Netflix Content Analysis - SQL Insights

**Project Overview**

Netflix is one of the leading streaming platforms globally, offering a vast library of movies, TV shows, and documentaries across various genres. As Netflix continues to expand its global footprint, understanding content distribution, user preferences, and regional trends is crucial for enhancing content recommendations and improving viewer satisfaction. This analysis is aimed at providing data-driven insights to optimize content categorization, safety, and regional content strategy.

The goal of this analysis is to categorize Netflix’s content into movies and TV shows, analyze regional content distribution, and assess viewer safety by identifying sensitive content. Key insights will drive content acquisition strategies, enhance regional targeting, and improve content moderation by filtering sensitive keywords like "kill" and "violence."

**Business Insights**
